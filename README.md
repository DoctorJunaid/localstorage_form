# LocalStorage Form

A simple web application demonstrating the use of the Web Storage API to persist form data using `localStorage`. This project showcases how to store and retrieve form inputs, providing a seamless user experience by retaining data even after page reloads.

## 🧰 Features

- **Persistent Form Data**: Uses `localStorage` to save and restore user inputs.
- **Minimal Setup**: Built using only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- **No Backend Required**: Entirely frontend-based.
- **Beginner Friendly**: Great for learning how local storage works in modern web browsers.

## 📁 Project Structure

```
localstorage_form/
├── home.html       # Main form page
├── login.html      # Sample login form
├── script.js       # Logic for localStorage handling
└── .gitattributes  # Git attributes file
```

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/DoctorJunaid/localstorage_form.git
```

### 2. Open the project:

You can open `home.html` directly in your web browser to see the form in action.

### 3. Use the form:

- Fill in the form.
- Submit it.
- Reload or revisit the page — your data will still be there, thanks to `localStorage`.

## 📚 About

This project demonstrates how client-side storage can be used to create a more resilient and user-friendly web experience. With `localStorage`, user input is automatically saved to the browser and reloaded when the page is refreshed.

Perfect for:
- Learning how to use the Web Storage API.
- Creating simple offline-capable applications.
- Avoiding data loss on accidental page reloads.
